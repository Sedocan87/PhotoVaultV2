# PhotoVault

A lightweight, fast desktop photo management app with automatic dual-drive backup synchronization.

## Vision

Keep your photo library organized locally with complete control over your data. PhotoVault lets you manage, organize, and filter your photos while automatically maintaining a perfect backup on a second drive. No cloud. No subscriptions. One-time purchase, lifetime use.

## Core Features

### Photo Management
- **Browse & Organize**: Navigate your photo library with folder structure support
- **Bulk Operations**: Rename photos in batch, organize into folders, move files efficiently
- **Smart Collections**: Create albums and organize photos by custom categories
- **Tagging & Metadata**: Add tags and manage EXIF data for better organization

### Discovery & Viewing
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by date, tags, resolution, file size, and more
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and remove duplicate photos intelligently
- **Slideshow Mode**: View your photos in a distraction-free slideshow experience

### The Killer Feature: Dual-Drive Synchronization
- **Automatic Mirroring**: Designate a primary drive and backup drive—all changes sync automatically
- **One Direction Sync**: Primary drive always leads; backup always follows its exact state
- **Accidental Deletion Recovery**: Delete files accidentally from the backup? They restore automatically to match the primary drive
- **Always Protected**: Your photos are never in a single point of failure
- **Manual Sync Redundancy**: Say goodbye to manual copy-paste workflows and lost track of backup status

## Why PhotoVault?

**For photographers & archivists**: Organize your collection locally without cloud dependencies

**For privacy-conscious users**: Your photos stay on your hardware, nowhere else

**For backup paranoia**: Stop manually syncing two drives and losing track of what's backed up

**For simplicity**: One lightweight app, not a suite of tools. Edit elsewhere if you need to.

## One-Time Purchase Model

No subscriptions. No recurring fees. One purchase, forever access. Updates included.

## Technical Philosophy

PhotoVault is intentionally focused. We do photo management and backup synchronization exceptionally well. We don't try to compete with specialized editors—that's not our job. Your favorite editing software handles edits; PhotoVault handles organization and protection.

## System Requirements

- **Windows 10+** / **macOS 11+** / **Linux** (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- Two storage devices (any combination of HDD/SSD) for dual-sync feature
- 100MB disk space for the app

## Getting Started

1. Download PhotoVault for your platform
2. Point the app at your photo library (primary drive)
3. Select a second drive for automatic backup
4. Start organizing—changes sync automatically to both drives

## Roadmap (Future Enhancements)

- Cloud storage integration (Nextcloud, Synology) as optional secondary backup
- Mobile companion app for remote viewing
- Advanced search with AI-powered organization
- Network drive support for NAS setups
- Performance improvements for 100k+ photo libraries

## What's Out of Scope

- Photo editing (use your favorite editor instead)
- Cloud sync across devices (intentionally local-first)
- Face recognition (keep it lightweight)
- AI tagging or auto-categorization (let users organize their way)
