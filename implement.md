This guide breaks down PhotoVault development into manageable phases with clear deliverables, milestones, and testing strategies.

**Estimated Timeline**: 16-20 weeks (vibe coding pace, working solo)

---

## Phase 0: Project Setup (Week 1)

Get the foundation solid so you can build fast later.

### Deliverables
- [ ] Tauri + React project scaffolded
- [ ] TypeScript configured
- [ ] Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui set up

   cargo tauri init

2. **Set Up Frontend Stack**
   - Install Tailwind CSS: `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
   - Set up shadcn/ui: `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`
   - Configure Vite for fast HMR

3. **Configure Rust Backend**
   - Verify Tauri core dependencies (already in place)
   - Add to `Cargo.toml`:
     ```toml
     tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
     sqlx = { version = "0.7", features = ["runtime-tokio-rustls", "sqlite"] }
     walkdir = "2"
     image = "0.24"
     sha2 = "0.10"

- *Mitigation*: Extensive testing in Phase 3, operation journaling, rollback capability

**Risk**: Performance degrades with 100k+ photos
- *Mitigation*: Pagination, indexing, lazy loading from start

**Risk**: Database corruption on backup drive
- *Mitigation*: Atomic operations, transaction support, regular integrity checks

### Project Risks

**Risk**: Scope creep (adding features mid-phase)
- *Mitigation*: Strict phase boundaries, defer non-essential features to "Future Enhancements"

**Risk**: Motivation dips on solo project
- *Mitigation*: Weekly shipped features, celebrate phase completions, stay focused on core

**Risk**: Platform-specific issues discovered late
- *Mitigation*: Test on all three platforms starting in Phase 1

## Phase Dependencies

Phases are mostly sequential, but some can overlap:

- Phases 0-3: Sequential (foundation)
- Phases 4-8: Can be reordered based on priority
- Phases 9-10: Before testing
- Phases 11-12: Must be last

## Time Buffer

Built-in 10-20% time buffer for:
- Unexpected bugs
- Platform-specific issues
- Design iterations
- Context switching overhead

Adjust phase durations based on your actual vibe coding pace.

## Post-Launch Roadmap

After 1.0 release:

- **1.1**: Cloud backup integration (Nextcloud)
- **1.2**: Mobile companion app
- **1.3**: Advanced search with ML
- **2.0**: Multi-device sync (optional cloud)

Keep 1.0 focused on the core promise: **organize photos locally, sync two drives perfectly**.
